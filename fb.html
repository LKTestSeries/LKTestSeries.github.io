Embedded Posts are a simple way to put public posts - by a Page or a person on Facebook - into the content of your web site or web page.
Only public posts from Facebook Pages and profiles can be embedded.

Getting your Code from a Post
1. Navigate to your Post
You can get the embed code directly from the post itself. If the post is public, click on the icon that appears in the top right corner of the post on Facebook.

Choose Embed Post from the drop down menu:

For photo posts select the Embed Post button on the bottom right:

2. Copy and Paste Code
You will see a dialog appear with the code to embed your post in it. Copy and paste this code into your web page in the place where you want it to appear.
